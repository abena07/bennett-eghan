_if you want to go fast, go alone — but if you want to go far, go with people._  
and honestly, it’s safe to say **far > fast** any day.

this past week, the importance of your people meant more to me than just words.

this piece is simply an appreciation post to say **thank you**, and **God bless you**.

independence is a myth as long as you're human. maybe if you're me (batman) then i can understand, but even me — i had robin and catwoman lol.  
the obvious point i'm trying to make is that you need people to do this life with. it makes life all the more bearable, that it does.

i presume there are stats to back how living with a partner increases your longevity as opposed to living alone. but beyond the data, i’m just deeply grateful for the people i get to do this life with. a village it takes truly.

so, to everyone who helped me navigate this past week: **i appreciate you. God bless you and thank you.**

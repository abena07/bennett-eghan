this is a simple piece that briefly encompasses what pub subs are, how they work & when you should use them.

### what are pub/subs?

pub/sub stands for **publisher/subscriber**. it is a communication pattern used to stream data in real-time systems, perfect for when you need data delivered instantly, like live comments or price updates.

### how do pub/subs work?

a pub/sub setup has three main parts:

* **publisher:** sends or publishes events
* **subscriber:** listens for or subscribes to events
* **topic:** the channel in between, managed by a message broker (like kafka, rabbitmq, or google pub/sub) that delivers messages from publishers to subscribers

publishers and subscribers are **decoupled**. they don’t know each other directly. the publisher just sends messages to a topic, and any subscriber to that topic automatically receives them.

when scaling, topics can be **split into partitions**, and each partition can be handled by a **consumer group**, allowing multiple subscribers to process data in parallel.

### when should you use pub/sub?

pub/sub systems shine when you need **real-time updates** or **event-driven communication**, like:

* a comment or chat section for a live stream such as tiktok or youtube
* a crypto or stock price tracker updating live
* sending notifications or syncing data across distributed systems

so the next time you need real-time updates or event-driven communication, think pub/subs

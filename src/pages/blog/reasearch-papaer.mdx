reading a research paper requires skill, much like any other task that demands expertise. at first, it can feel overwhelming and discouraging. however, to read one effectively, it helps to follow a rubric to keep you on track.

before diving into our rule of thumb, it's important to understand that every research paper follows a certain _structure_:

- **introduction**: this section highlights the motivation behind the work and provides an outline of the proposed solution.
- **body**: here, the solution is explained in detail.
- **conclusion**: a recap of the paper, along with a discussion of its main contributions.

our rules of thumb for reading research papers are as follows:

### 1. **what is the motivation of the paper?**

- every paper begins with a problem that it seeks to address. this problem usually has two components:
    - the _people problem_: what real-world issue or benefit is being targeted?
    - the _technical problem_: why isn't there an obvious or trivial solution to the people problem?
- these two aspects are distilled into the _research question_, which drives the study.

### 2. **what is the proposed solution?**

- the proposed solution is the hypothesis or idea that aims to solve the research question.
- evaluate the solution by considering:
    - why it works or is expected to work.
    - why it's an improvement over existing solutions.
    - the practical steps to achieve it.

### 3. **what is the evaluation of the proposed solution?**

- a solid paper doesn't just propose an idea—it tests it. this includes:
    - experiments, simulations, or arguments that validate the solution.
    - evidence that demonstrates why the solution is effective.

### 4. **what is your analysis of the identified problem, idea, and evaluation?**

- it's crucial to critically assess the paper:
    - is the proposed idea feasible?
    - will it work as intended?
    - what are its limitations or drawbacks?
- you should form your own perspective and challenge the writer's conclusions when necessary.

### 5. **what are the contributions?**

- every paper should bring something new to the table, whether it's:
    - a novel idea, tool, or method.
    - improvements to existing approaches.

### 6. **what are the future directions for research?**

- after reading, reflect on:
    - areas for improvement that the authors didn't address.
    - new ideas or questions that arise as a result of the research.

### 7. **what questions are you left with?**

- consider what remains unclear or unresolved:
    - were there parts of the paper that confused you?
    - what additional information do you need to fully understand the topic?
- these lingering questions can help shape further exploration.

### 8. **what are your key takeaways?**

- summarize the paper's core ideas in a concise format for quick reference.
- this summary will help you recall the main points and significance of the work in the future.

by following these rules of thumb, you can systematically break down and understand research papers, making the process less daunting and more effective.

to conclude, effectively reading a research paper requires systematically addressing all the outlined questions through careful note-taking. if any questions remain unanswered, your reading isn't complete. revisiting the paper a second time is often necessary to fully grasp its ideas and connect the dots.

with consistent practice, this method will transform the process into a valuable and rewarding skill.

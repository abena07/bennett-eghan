(…or how to stop being passive at work - for anyone who struggles with that)

everything i share here is based solely on my experience - no stats, no research papers. just what i've observed working in tech, mostly as the only woman on the team.

it's very easy to be laid back and quiet, thinking pushing code is enough. the expectation is that everyone should know how to code or do their work, so "just do your task and go" won't fly if you want to make impact or be "seen" (i use "seen" loosely here). 

you need to unlearn a lot. you need to be assertive and not reticent. move with urgency. over-communicate. contribute. be proactive. take initiative. take ownership. be someone whose word means something. finish things.

these are the things that helped me improve, and they're the things that will help you navigate male-dominated spaces - and honestly, they're helpful for anyone who tends to be reserved at work.

## **1. move with urgency & be proactive**

dragging your feet is the fastest way to lose trust. sitting quietly on a blocker will kill your momentum.

if a deadline is 3 days, try to finish in 1-2.

not because you're trying to impress anyone - but because ***software is unpredictable***, and padding yourself gives room for debugging, reviews, and scope changes.

and we have ai now. if you're stuck, don't just sit there. use ai, ask peers, bounce ideas around. and if you're still blocked, schedule a quick call with a senior. don't wait for someone to ask.

people respect tenacity.

## **2. over-communicate**

once i worked with a senior colleague and during one of our sprints he told me that: *"it's better to disappoint me early than disappoint me late."* that stuck with me. communication is how you become reliable. give updates before you're asked. you can keep it brief & share just what matters:

- what you're working on  
- where you are  
- what's blocked  
- what's next  

start-of-business-day and end-of-business-day updates can go a long way, especially in remote teams. avoid vague messages like *"still working on it"* - try to be very very specific.

---

## **3. under-promise & over-deliver**

this is a simple but powerful strategy: don't commit to more than you can realistically achieve. give yourself a buffer for debugging, reviews, or scope changes. whenever possible, finish early or add a little extra polish.

under-promising keeps expectations realistic. over-delivering shows people you can be counted on. together, it builds a reputation that lasts.

and in the delivery, double check, triple check, test to break. your work is a version of you so always deliver your best work.

---

## **4. be reliable**

reliability is one of the fastest ways to gain trust in a team. people notice when you consistently meet deadlines, finish what you say you will, and follow up on blockers while communicating issues early.

mostly in a team where you are supposed to report back to someone, this should be a priority. respond to messages promptly, don't avoid calls or check-ins, and as much as possible be there when you're needed.

---

## **5. take initiative & show ownership**

when working on a team and say you happen to have some time on your hands or in addition to your task and can ship more - ship more. if the codebase is messy, improve it. if something can be automated, suggest it. if a feature can be better, bring it up. this shows that you have taken the product as your own, a very good sense of ***ownership***.

this is what makes you stand out in any team - especially where people don't expect much from you because you're quiet or the only woman.

ownership builds reputation and complements reliability. when you proactively take charge, your team notices, and trust grows.

---

## **6. take feedback well**

anytime feedback is given, take it with a grain of salt.

i saw a tweet that said "whenever i request a review on a pr, i remember mauro and put my emotions aside". i didn't know who mauro was, but i could relate to why you have to put your emotions aside - especially in tech. [for more context](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/1ahjif6/linus_is/?share_id=cQDK1lzOijQmSHVOAYaC5&utm_content=0&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)

code reviews aren't personal; they're about improving the project. say thank you. fix it. then tell them you've fixed it.

these principles aren't just about surviving male-dominated spaces - they're about thriving in any environment where your work needs to speak for itself. the key is being proactive, reliable, and visible in ways that matter.

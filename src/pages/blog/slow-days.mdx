what do you do when there's no one watching? what do you do when there's no kpi to meet? what do you do when there's no bread to be made? so a better way to put my question is: ***what do you enjoy doing?***

today, it's very easy to always seem busy. it's easy to be on the move. it's easy to forget what you're chasing and why. which is why i say slow days are my formative days. on slow days i get to reflect on who i actually want to be. who i want to be known for. things i should be doing that i am not doing.

*slow days are days i check in with the little things that mean a lot:* how many times i went for a walk this week, how many times i read my bible this week, how many times i was able to wake up early. slow days are also days i decide to take a break in the coming weeks, to step out to my favorite coffee shop or just rot in bed.

because the truth is, the world is speeding up. everything is instant and quick. and these instant noodles, instant gratifications, quick replies, quick deliveries, among others have really wired us to thinking that's how life generally is. but perhaps that’s just me.

these days, what actually is power to me is when amidst everything you're able to know when to pause and go again. power is pacing yourself. because whatever race you're in is indeed a marathon and not a sprint (cliché but true).

i’m reminded of something marcus aurelius said: 
> you have power over your mind; not outside events. realize this, and you will find strength.

and maybe that’s what all this comes down to, learning to slow down, to return inward, and to choose your pace in a world that rarely waits.

so be intentional about those slow days, be intentional about those reflective days, be intentional about those formative days. and as of now, that's only how i know you don't forget about things you love to do, things you need to do that are healthy, and things you need to do simply because you enjoy doing them.
